The statement said the officer will appear at Westminster magistrates' court on Saturday for his first hearing.\nDetectives searching for the woman found a body in woodland in Kent on Wednesday evening, said Nick Ephgrave, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. \"I can now confirm that it is the body of Sarah Everard.\"\n\"A man remains in custody at a London police station on suspicion of committing those crimes,\" Ephgrave said. A post-mortem examination will now take place on Everard's remains.\nEverard disappeared on March 3 while walking in Clapham, south London, prompting an extensive police search in the area.\nHer remains were eventually found more than 50 miles from where she was last seen. A police officer whose \"primary role was uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises\" was arrested in Kent on Tuesday evening.\nOn Friday, Everard's family described her as a \"shining example\" who was \"kind and strong\" as they appealed for anyone with information to help detectives.\n\"Sarah was bright and beautiful -- a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour,\" her family said.\nOn Thursday, the police watchdog said in a statement that it had started an independent investigation into police actions involving the suspect.\n\"I know that the public feels hurt and angry about what has happened. And those are sentiments that I share personally, and I know my colleagues here at Scotland Yard and across the Met share as well,\" Ephgrave said on Friday.\nEverard's disappearance prompted thousands of women to share their own experiences of intimidation or harassment while walking alone at night in British cities and around the world.\nMany also exchanged notes on the habitual precautions they take to try to stay safe when they walk alone -- and voiced their anger and frustration that this feels necessary.\n\"I understand that women in London and the wider public, particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing, will be worried and may well be feeling frightened,\" Ephgrave said Friday, adding that Londoners could expect to see a rise in officers on the street in the coming days.\nA \"Reclaim These Streets\" vigil has been organized via Facebook for 6 p.m. Saturday on Clapham Common, a green space Everard walked near at around 9 p.m. as she headed toward her home in Brixton.\nIt is unclear whether the event can legally go ahead, given the UK's current Covid-19 restrictions banning public gatherings.

It's something that he says has been extra important during such tough times.\n\"When you're able to provide that kind of care and consideration that you would to a family member or a friend or someone that you just care about, why is it any different for a relationship between the sports team and its fans?

On the online platform, fans can win points for engaging with the team's social media which can in turn earn them special experiences with their favorite team and players.\nIt also provides a space for fans to talk to one another and play specialized games.\n\"It's very exciting to get some kind of reward for what you do there with them, simply because it's some kind of reward for things that you're already doing,\" says Romann.\nThe new platform encourages fans to connect their social media accounts allowing Team Liquid a chance to learn more about its fan base and tailor content accordingly.\nIn many ways, Liquid+ is the first of its kind and Arhancet says it won't be long before other teams follow suit.\n\"I think it's good that other esports teams are thinking about it in this way, and I think it will overall help the esports ecosystem,\" he says.\n\"I'm kind of glad to see that kind of innovation happen by other teams. It will level up what we're doing.\"\nBeing able to provide this \"virtual stadium\" will also help esports stay ahead of the curve in terms of more traditional sports, says Arhancet.\n\"We don't have big stadiums, but what we do have is this kind of digital stadium where we can provide the same sort of experiences and events and even food and beverage,\" he says.\n\"It's not limited to just the folks that are coming to that 10,000 person stadium.

To him, the F1 great was just his dad.\nAs he grew older, however, he began to see the value in all the lessons his dad gave him. Today, Schumacher sees many of his father's traits in his own driving style and doesn't shy away from the comparisons.\n\"I guess we're probably different in a few ways, but we're very similar in other ways,\" he explains. \"It's very interesting to see how we how we do things on track. For me, when I compare myself [to him], it is very much in his prime, the peak of his career when he was racing with Ferrari and having all those world championships.\n\"But it's also very good for me to compare myself to him when he started in Formula One ... we just have to be able to compare in both phases I'd say -- compare myself to the beginning, but also compared to the end of his career.\nREAD: Can Mick Schumacher emulate his father Michael in Formula One?\n\"You always have to measure yourself to the best today, but also to the best in the past and obviously my dad is the best and he's always going to be the best. I feel privileged to be able to compare myself to him and see what steps he took over the years, but [also] what different choices he took and I learned from them.\"\nDespite his upbringing as the son of one of the greatest drivers of all time, it wasn't always a given that Schumacher would reach motorsport's elite level.\nIn 2019, he finished his first season in Formula Two in 12th place, 213 points behind the eventual champion despite driving for the best team in the championship.\nFollowing a frank discussion with his PREMA Racing team principle Rene Rosin, his fortunes transformed and in 2020 he was crowned F2 champion, winning the title by 14 points.\nFerrari, the team with which Michael Schumacher became synonymous, has been crucial in aiding Mick's development as a driver. The German is part of the Italian team's prestigious Ferrari Driver Academy, signing up in 2019, and joins a list of alumni that includes Charles Leclerc, Antonio Giovinazzi and the late Jules Bianchi.\nAlthough his position in the sport may have looked somewhat precarious from the outside, Schumacher's drive and work ethic meant he was always likely to succeed.\n\"Obviously you always have to have a basis of talent on any anything you do and I feel like through karting and through racing, you just learn to adapt to things very quickly,\" he explains. \"So I'm generally very easily learning new things, especially when it's something about sports.\n\"I guess in our sport, if you love what you do and you have a bit of talent and you are willing to work for your dream, that's all it takes in a way to be able to then put a lot of time on track. If you are willing to to work every day, every minute on yourself and dedicate life, basically, to the sport, then most likely [you] will do well -- and that's what I'm doing.\"\nSuch was his love of driving growing up, Schumacher admits there was \"never a plan B.\" While the other kids at school dreamed of becoming astronauts or the president, his singular focus was on racing around a track.\nIn Bahrain later this month, his dream of becoming a Formula One driver like his father will be realized.\n\"I guess I will be a bit nervous, but nevertheless I think I'm very much prepared,\" he says. \"It's going to be very fun. I think it's going to be a hell of a ride.\"\n\n"}, {"title": "They can only hold hands, but for Britain's elderly, first touch with a relative 'means everything'", "author": "Phil Black and Mick Krever", "date": "2021-03-12", "full_article": "Eastbourne, England (CNN)In a small nursing home by the southern English seaside, David Alexander, 89, walks into his wife's bedroom for the first time since October.\n\"Hello my darling,\" he says. \"Do you know who I am?

Prime Minister Boyko Borissov ordered a halt to all inoculation using the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine until the European Medicines Agency \"rejects all doubts\" about the vaccine's safety, according to a government statement.\nThe moves came in response to reports of blood clots in a few inoculated people in Denmark, including one fatality. Denmark was the first country to take the precautionary measure, announcing a 14-day break while authorities investigated further.\nNorway and Iceland soon followed. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said the country has also reported cases of blood clots shortly after receiving a Covid-19 vaccination in Norway but \"mainly in the elderly where there is often another underlying disease as well.\"\nOther countries, including Austria and Italy, have suspended specific batches of the vaccine.\nBut a number of nations -- including Germany, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Mexico and Nigeria -- stood by the shot and reassured citizens of its safety.\nHealth agencies tell countries to keep rolling out\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) said Thursday that it did not recommend suspending use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, stating that there is \"no indication\" the vaccine caused the blood clots in the people who received the vaccine.

The EMA said Wednesday there was \"no indication\" that vaccination had been behind the cases of clotting or death.\nAnd on Thursday, Italian medicines agency AIFA also banned use of another batch of AstraZeneca vaccines. The agency said it was responding to \"some serious adverse events\" taking place around the time of vaccinations from one specific batch. It did not say what the events were and said no causal link between the events and the vaccine had been established.\nNigeria, which has started receiving millions of vaccine doses through the COVAX program, defended the vaccine Thursday, saying it is satisfied with the clinical evidence indicating the shot is \"safe and effective\" and urging its citizens to continue to participate in the rollout.\nReal-world data has also shown that the vaccine is having a significant impact in reducing Covid-19 hospitalizations.\nA single dose of the vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization from Covid-19 by more than 80% in people aged over 80, data from Public Health England showed earlier this month. The vaccine is given in two doses, though countries differ in how far apart they are spreading those shots.\nConcerns about the vaccine's safety nonetheless come at an awkward time for AstraZeneca, with disputes over its supplies to the EU still unresolved. After announcing it would pause the vaccine, Denmark's health authority said Thursday the country would now receive approximately 900,000 fewer doses of the shot.\n\"The fact that AstraZeneca is once again downgrading the number of doses delivered to the EU and thus Denmark is, of course, both unsatisfactory and a serious challenge,\" Ole Jensen, deputy director at the Statens Serum Institut, said.\nPolish officials also announced on Friday that AstraZeneca will reduce the number of coronavirus vaccine doses delivered there.\nCNN's Antonia Mortensen, Schams Elwazer, Arnaud Siad, Vee Intarakatug and Chris Liakos contributed reporting.\n"}, {"title": "'It was a horrendous tee shot': Players Championship famed 17th hole claims victims", "author": "Ben Morse", "date": "2021-03-12", "full_article": "(CNN)Golfer Byeong Hun An is unlikely to forget in a hurry the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass.\nThe South Korean hit his ball in the water four times on the par-three on Thursday in the first round of the Players Championship., eventually carding an octuple bogey 11.\n\"We all have bad days in our life and we just have to learn to move on ...

Did we make it?\" Gibson laughed.\nNow that hope and optimism is tinged with the deep pain of racial trauma -- the struggles of an American actress living in the palace spoke directly to the lived experience of ordinary Black Britons.\n\"I think my reaction was still? Are we here still in 2021?\" Gibson said of the explosive interview.\nGibson feels her words about Meghan have been misrepresented in the media before -- an experience she says left her \"traumatized\" and led to a \"loss of trust\" in journalists.\n\nAt a time of nationwide lockdown, the UK's mainstream media is its public square -- a space that many Black Britons say is hostile to them.\nBuckingham Palace said in a statement this week that, \"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning.\"\nIn response to Harry's accusation that British tabloids are \"bigoted\" and build a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear,\" the UK's Society of Editors claimed racism played no part in the coverage of the Duchess. The group's head stepped down after a swift rebuke from more than 160 journalists of color. calling the statement \"willful ignorance.\"\n\"The blanket refusal to accept there is any bigotry in the British press is laughable, does a disservice to journalists of color and shows an institution and an industry in denial,\" they added.\nPopular TV host Piers Morgan's claim on one of Britain's most watched morning shows that he \"didn't believe a word\" that Meghan was saying led to 41,000 complaints to the UK's communication regulator. An investigation was launched, and the famous presenter lost his top gig.\nOn Wednesday, Morgan said that he still does not believe Meghan.\n\"I've had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don't [believe her],\" Morgan tweeted. \"If you did, OK. Freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on. Thanks for all the love, and hate. I'm off to spend more time with my opinions.\"\nShola Mos-Shogbamimu, whose heated on-air exchange with Morgan went viral after he questioned Meghan's truthfulness during her Oprah interview, says it's going to take more than a couple of resignations to heal the divide.\n\"There is the issue of the lack of trust in the media,\" Mos-Shogbamimu said. \"If the media is going to change your words, the tone of your words, how are you going to trust them with your most valuable asset which is your voice.\"\nThe Britain that Prince Harry and Meghan left is already changing. It was rocked by a racial reckoning after the death of George Floyd in the US, that pushed tens of thousands of anti-racism demonstrators onto the streets of the UK. That hope for change is quickly turning into a demand for equality.\n\"I cannot waste my energy on those who are still on the ABCs, 123s, do-re-mis of racism,\" Mos-Shogbamimu explained, \"I recognize that those who are against progress on racial equality and racial justice ... one of their tactics is to frustrate the efforts of anti-racist activist like me, so if they have me arguing at the 123 level, where is my energy to deal with the real fight?\"\nAway from the British mainstream media -- an overwhelmingly white institution -- Zeze Millz has carved out her own space on social media.\nHer weekly YouTube show speaks to an audience of 120,000 on cultural and political issues.\n\"We've been nice.

Iceland and Norway followed suit, but did not say how long their suspensions would last.\nDanish Health Minister Magnus Heunicke made clear the pause was a \"precautionary measure,\" saying it was not possible yet to draw conclusions.\n\"We act early, it needs to be thoroughly investigated,\" he said in a tweet.\nThe Danish Health Authority also stressed that the decision was temporary.\n\"We are in the middle of the largest and most important vaccination rollout in Danish history. And right now we need all the vaccines we can get. Therefore, putting one of the vaccines on pause is not an easy decision. But precisely because we vaccinate so many, we also need to respond with timely care when there is knowledge of possible serious side effects. We need to clarify this before we can continue to use the vaccine from AstraZeneca,\" S\u00f8ren Brostr\u00f8m, director of the National Board of Health, said in the statement.\n\n\"It is important to emphasize that we have not opted out of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but that we are putting it on hold. There is good evidence that the vaccine is both safe and effective. But both we and the Danish Medicines Agency have to react to reports of possible serious side effects, both from Denmark and other European countries. It shows that the monitoring system works. \"\nSpeaking to CNN Kjartan Nj\u00e1lsson, assistant to the director of health in Iceland, said that although there had been no reports of patients developing blood clots in the country, they were waiting for advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). \"It's the lack of data right now that concerns us,\" he added.\nThe EMA said later Thursday that it did not recommend suspending use of the vaccine.\nThe agency said it was aware that Denmark had suspended use but that there was \"currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine.\"\n\"The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,\" the agency added.\nThe EMA also noted that the number of blood clots seen in vaccine recipients was no higher than the rate among people who had not received the shot in Europe.\nThe Norwegian Institute of Public Health issued a statement saying the country had also chosen to \"pause\" inoculations following report of a death in Denmark as a result of a blood clot. It also noted there had been reported cases of blood clots shortly after receiving Covid-19 vaccinations in Norway but \"mainly in the elderly where there is often another underlying disease as well.\"\nSpain's Public Health Commission announced Thursday that it was delaying the vaccination of people aged between 55 and 65 years old with the AstraZeneca vaccine until \"there is a full review and conclusion of side effects by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\", according to a commission statement issued on Thursday evening.\nSpanish health minister Carolina Darias called for calm earlier on Thursday. \"I would to send a message of calm and caution. In Spain we have not been notified of any case related to blood clots,\" Darias told local TV station La Sexta.\nThe Public Health Commission includes the country's Ministry of Health and representatives of Spain's 17 regions.\nEarlier this week, a number of EU nations paused the use of doses that came from a particular batch of AstraZeneca vaccine, after a 49-year-old woman in Austria died of multiple thrombosis on Sunday.

The safety of the vaccine has been extensively studied in Phase III clinical trials and peer-reviewed data confirms the vaccine is generally well tolerated,\" the company said in a statement.\nIn the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Danish authorities had taken a \"precautionary measure\" and advised people to still take their vaccine when instructed to.\nThe Dutch health minister also said there was no reason to stop using the vaccine.\n\"Our experts say there is no cause for concern, we can simply continue vaccinating,\" Hugo de Jonge said Thursday.\nAustria, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Latvia have suspended the use of doses from batch ABV5300. Danish officials did not specify whether its reported death was connected to the same batch.\nThe EMA said that batch ABV5300 had been delivered to 17 EU countries, comprising 1 million doses of the vaccine.\n\"Some EU countries have also subsequently suspended this batch as a precautionary measure, while a full investigation is ongoing. Although a quality defect is considered unlikely at this stage, the batch quality is being investigated,\" EMA said in a statement.\nThe investigation is the latest trouble in Europe for British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, which has come under pressure to produce more vaccines after it fell tens of millions of doses short in deliveries to the European Union.\nOn Thursday, Italian medicines agency AIFA also banned use of another batch of AstraZeneca vaccines. The agency said it was responding to \"some serious adverse events\" taking place around the time of vaccinations from batch ABV2856. It did not say what the events were and said no causal link between the events and the vaccine had been established.\nItaly banned the export of 250,000 doses of the vaccine to Australia last week in an effort to protect its national supplies. France said it would also consider banning exports, as concerns of vaccine nationalism rise.\nThe company has also faced resistance in the bloc, where regulatory bodies in member countries have been slow or hesitated to recommend the vaccine in people over the age of 65, citing a lack of data.\nRegulatory bodies in several countries, including Germany and France, have since changed recommendations to include over-65s as real-world data has since shown that the AstraZeneca vaccine is highly effective at preventing hospitalization in older populations. France limits the shot to people under the age of 74.\nAnecdotal reports suggest people in some EU countries, however, are still choosing not to take the AstraZeneca vaccine.Correction: A previous version of this story reported that Italy banned batch ABV5300. It has been corrected to show that Italy banned a different AstraZeneca batch over concerns around unspecified adverse reactions.\nCNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report.\n"}, {"title": "Frisbee and oval ball star Cat Phillips fired up by fight for gender equality", "author": "Becky Thompson, for CNN", "date": "2021-03-11", "full_article": "(CNN)For someone who describes herself as a \"pretty quiet person,\" Cat Phillips has shown herself to be utterly unafraid of speaking out.\nA rarity in the sporting world, Phillips is a multi-sport athlete, who competes in both ultimate frisbee and Australian football.\nWhile the Australian Football League men's competition was founded in 1896, the women's inaugural season didn't kick off until 2017.\nFor some AFL fans the idea of women showcasing their handling and kicking skills with the oval-shape ball has come as a bit of a culture shock, according to Phillips.\n\"A lot of the comments that you get in Australia around the AFLW [Australian Football League Women's], are that the quality of the league isn't good enough and women shouldn't be being paid because they're just not good enough,\" Phillips told CNN Sport, as she reflected on what it's been like playing in the fledgling league.\nNo wonder, perhaps, that Phillips feels so strongly about gender equality.\n\"That, to me, is just the lack of education,\" adds the 29-year-old, who points out that perhaps if these men hadn't grown up playing Aussie football and were working full-time and training in the evening, the same way the women are, the quality of the league would be different.\nIn 2020, the average AFL men's player earned $215,890 USD while the highest-earning player in the league earned $924,289. In contrast, the highest paid women's players earned only $23,002.\nPhillips is also the co-founder of the Australian Ultimate League -- the only mixed-gender, semi-professional field sport in the world.\nAnd somehow, the two-sport star also finds the time to work as an engineer.\nUltimate frisbee is a self-officiated sport that is played mixed-gender at the highest level -- the World Games.\nHowever, many semi-professional leagues have opted for single-gender competition, making what Phillips has done in Australia special.\nPhillips says her experience in ultimate frisbee has been more positive than it has been in the AFLW when it comes to issues of equality.\n\nRole model\nBorn in London, Phillips grew up in Melbourne, where she discovered her love of ultimate frisbee in high school before she was selected for the ALFW's inaugural season during a talent search.\n\"I think I took it for granted that a lot of parts of ultimate are very equal, relatively speaking, and that was something that I really loved about it at the beginning. But I probably didn't recognize the importance of it until I moved into football.\"\nHowever, she appreciates the platform the ALFW has given her.\n\"Coming into the AFLW, I saw the impact that we had on young girls but also on young boys -- people who all of a sudden were looking at the league and had female role models that they could look up to -- and that has really impacted me,\" said Phillips.\nAs captain of the Australian women's ultimate frisbee team and the captain of St. Kilda FC in the AFLW, Phillips is determined to use her leadership positions to help create change.\n\"For me, it's not even about the players that are playing in the league. Obviously, I want equality for them, but it's more about the broader impact of it.\n\"Kids who, at eight or nine ... [who see] it's normal that you would have women playing at that level. And I think that's really powerful and I feel very strongly that we need to keep moving forward in that area.\"\n\nMixed-gender league\nAs ultimate frisbee has grown over the last decade, semi-professional leagues have begun to pop up around the globe.\nThe American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) was founded in 2010 and played its inaugural season in 2012.\nBut the league was created for men's teams only, although it did allow women to try-out for teams.\nDespite discussions and a push from the ultimate community to add women's teams to the league, the AUDL has remained a men's league.\nIn 2018, when Phillips started the Australian Ultimate League (AUL), she opted for a different approach, creating the world's first mixed- gender league in the world to provide an equal opportunity for men and women to compete.\nIn the years that have followed the AUL's creation, women's leagues such as the Premier Ultimate League (PUL) have been set up in the US.\nWhat Phillips has done by creating a mixed-gender league is not only in line with the sport's highest level -- it's played as a mixed sport at the World Games -- but also with the International Olympic Committee's vision to create a more gender-equitable Games by including more mixed events.\nAnd, as ultimate strives for inclusion in the Olympic Games, Phillips believes it is important for the sport to show that it's unique -- and that women can compete with men on the same field.\n\nLeadership skills\nDespite the fact she holds the position of captain on two sports teams, Phillips says the idea of leadership didn't come easily.\n\"I like to keep to myself a little bit, but again the more involved I've got in footy and in ultimate, and in thinking about gender equity in particular, it's definitely become more important to me,\" she explains.\n\"I look at a lot of the young players that are coming through both in footy and in ultimate, and I just see so much potential in them.\n\"They're all such incredible young women and I feel a lot of ownership and responsibility around helping them to grow and helping them to develop into really strong, powerful women.\"\nThese days it isn't easy being a female leader.\nIn early 2020, the online abuse of AFLW players became so bad that some organizations had to shut down their comments sections.\nNotably a photo of Carlton Blues player Tayla Harris, which captured her athleticism, gained significant negative attention and Australian broadcaster Channel 7 removed the post after only 24 hours as the comments had become too difficult to monitor.\nPhillips says social media doesn't play a big part in her life, which has ensured she hasn't been as affected as other athletes who have suffered abuse.\n\"Obviously, I know that it's there and I think you only have to read the comments on one article posted online to get a broad view of the things that people think.\"\nShe also believes there's a groundswell of support for the AFLW and says that it's just a matter of time before the league is given the recognition and respect it deserves.\n\"One, the quality will keep going up,\" reflects Phillips. \"And two, I think the more people get exposed to it and start to understand a bit more about the differences between what the men and the women are doing, the feel about it in the community will change.\n\"There are a whole lot of people that are very supportive and very much on board with the league.\n\"And I tend to engage with those people, because they love what we're doing, and I think it's much more positive to keep focused on that.\"\n\nVision\nAccording to Phillips, the number of women playing Australian Football at grassroots level has increased significantly.\n\"Even if you just walked down to the local park five years ago, you would only have seen men or boys playing the footy and now you'll see girls everywhere kicking the footy.\"\nPhillips has a 10-year vision that AFLW players will mostly be full-time and don't have to balance careers while competing, though she admits that such a prospect is unlikely for ultimate frisbee.\n\"I think the cool thing here in Australia with ultimate is looking at the development of our youth pathways,\" said Phillips.\n\"Back when I started, there were a handful of people playing at my age. I think there were only about four in Victoria, where I come from.\n\"Now we have teams in every state in Australia and they have a youth national championship.\n\"That's just bringing more people into the game younger and it's the same with the AFL; the earlier you start playing, the better you'll get.\"\nPhillips is currently competing in the AFLW season, with the goal of winning the Premiership trophy at the end of April, all while she continues to train for her  other goal of competing in her third World Games for Australia in ultimate in 2022.\n\n"}, {"title": "Dutch inventor of the cassette tape, Lou Ottens, dies age 94", "author": "Christopher Johnson and Chloe Adams", "date": "2021-03-11", "full_article": "(CNN)Lou Ottens, the Dutch inventor of the cassette tape, has died at the age of 94, his family has confirmed to CNN.\nThey said the inventor died at his home in Duizel, the Netherlands, on Saturday. His cause of death was not given.\nAn estimated 100 billion cassette tapes have been sold worldwide, according to Philips, the company he began working for in 1952. Ottens also supervised the team that developed the compact disc (CD).\nOttens was described by Olga Coolen, the director of the Philips Museum in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, as an \"extraordinary man who loved technology.\"\nAn engineer by trade, five years after joining Philips, Ottens became the head of the company's product development department at its audio plant in Hasselt, Belgium.\nIn 1960, Ottens and his team developed the first portable tape recorder. At the time, all recorders used the reel-to-reel system, which meant the tape had to be manually wound.\nHe revolutionized recorders two years later by inventing the compact cassette. Because of the laborious nature of the reel-to-reel process, Ottens wanted to simplify the process, said his family.\nOttens cut a block of wood that would fit into the side of his jacket pocket to find an ideal size for the new carrier. The block became the model after which the first portable cassette recorder was made, said Philips.\nRemarkably, his wooden prototype was later lost when used to prop up his jack while changing a flat tire, Philips added.\nIn 1963, the development of the cassette and the playback device had done so well that they were presented at the Internationale Funkausstellung -- a trade exhibition for audio products -- in Berlin.\nGuests from Japan were inspired by his invention. The cassette was quickly copied by Japanese manufacturers into a different format and sold onto the Japanese market, Philips said.\nThe cassette recorder was a huge hit around the world, but particularly with young people in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\nThe device helped capture iconic sounds, according to Philips, which recounted a tale shared by Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, who wrote in his 2010 autobiography \"Life\": \"I wrote the song 'Satisfaction' in my sleep. I didn't know at all that I had recorded it, the song only exists thank God to the little Philips cassette recorder. I looked at it in the morning -- I knew I had put a new tape in the night before -- but it was at the very end. Apparently, I had recorded something. I rewound and then 'Satisfaction' sounded ... and then 40 minutes of snoring.\"\nOttens supervised the team that invented the CD, which was produced extensively by Sony-Philips and sold more than 200 billion copies worldwide, said Philips. He retired in 1986.\nIn 2013, on the 50th anniversary of the cassette tape, a special exhibition was created to honor Ottens' work at the Philips Museum. And the first-ever cassette recorder still lies on display as \"a testimony to his foresight and innovation,\" a representative from Philips told CNN.\n\"Lou was an extraordinary man who loved technology,\" said Coolen, director of the Philips Museum, in a statement to CNN, adding that his inventions had \"humble beginnings.\"\n\n"}, {"title": "Lionel Messi scores 'special' goal but misses penalty as Barcelona crashes out of the Champions League", "author": "Ben Church", "date": "2021-03-11", "full_article": "(CNN)It wasn't enough to ensure Barcelona progressed to the Champions League quarterfinals but Lionel Messi's strike against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday will live long in the memory.\nNeeding to score at least four goals to overcome a disastrous 4-1 first-leg result, Barcelona's task was made almost impossible after Kylian Mbappe converted a penalty for PSG on the half-hour.\nIn the past, when it needed a miracle, Messi has often worked his magic and the captain started to cast his spell at the Parc des Princes.\nThe Argentine picked the ball up in the middle of the pitch drove at the PSG defense. As good as Messi is, there didn't seem to be a great deal of danger but the magician then shifted the ball onto his left foot.\nSeemingly out of nowhere, he unleashed a ferocious effort from 25-yards that rocketed into the top corner of the net. Blink and you would have missed it.\nMessi has scored plenty of goals in his career --  this effort was his 120th goal in the Champions League -- but he hasn't scored many better than that.\nBarcelona boss Ronald Koeman's astonished expression on the sideline summed up the strike perfectly.\n\"He's been sensational in the first half, but this goal from Messi is something special,\" tweeted former Barcelona player Gary Lineker.\nPSG could have been forgiven for wondering if they were about to experience part two of La Remontada -- \"The Comeback\" -- in  2017 when the French side were beaten 6-1 by Barca having won the first leg 4-0 in the Champions League quarterfinals.\nHowever, Messi then managed to drop his wand when he missed a first-half penalty which perhaps would have given his side some hope of recreating that remarkable 2017 comeback.\nInstead, the match ended 1-1 and PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino was glad his side survived what could have been an embarrassing repeat performance.\n\"We suffered a lot in the first half, and psychologically it was a test for us.

You just have to watch, and rewatch, Messi's goal against PSG for proof of that.\nThere's no mistaking their mastery of the art. And for all the moments of magic they've created, remember Messi has only won one Champions League title in the last 10 years.\nWhat we do have with Mbappe and Haaland is two young talents absolutely stepping up to the plate when it matters, and rightly, people are getting excited.

The suspect has since been discharged from hospital and returned to police custody.\nPolice searching for Everard, who was last seen on March 3 in Clapham, south London, have found what appear to be human remains in woodland in Kent, the force confirmed late Wednesday.\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick pointed out that it was \"incredibly rare for women to be abducted\" in the streets.\n\nBut, she added, \"I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public -- particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing -- will be worried and may well be feeling scared.\"\nPolice making door-to-door inquiries in the case reportedly warned women not to venture out alone, prompting some to comment that this approach only fuels the culture of blaming victims.\nA \"Reclaim These Streets\" vigil has been organized via Facebook for 6 p.m. Saturday on Clapham Common, a green space Everard is believed to have crossed soon after 9 p.m. as she walked toward her home in Brixton. \"This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day,\" the organizers said.

If this conversation can help all of us start a convo about callling out this behaviour, we would all feel a lot safer.\"\n\nSexual harassment\nWhile instances of abduction are relatively rare in the UK, new polling indicates that sexual harassment and abuse are not.\nOver 70% of women surveyed by UN Women UK said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces. That figure rose to 97% among women aged 18 to 24, polling showed. The data, released Wednesday, was drawn from a YouGov survey of over 1,000 women commissioned by UN Women UK in January 2021.\nThe organization's polling also suggested that women have little faith in public institutions to tackle the situation.\n\"Only 4% of women told us they reported the incidents of harassment to an official organisation -- with 45% of women saying they didn't believe reporting would help change anything,\" UN Women UK said.\nOne in four women in the UK will experience domestic abuse and one in five sexual assault during her lifetime, according to a paper published by the Home Office in 2019.\nOf course, women are not alone in feeling under threat on the streets. And men are more likely to be the victims of violent crime involving strangers and acquaintances than are women, according to the annual Crime Survey for England and Wales, published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nBut government data show that men are far more likely to be prosecuted for acts of violence against both women and men. Over the three-year period ending March 2020, the vast majority of suspects convicted of homicide were male -- 93% of the total, according to an ONS report on homicide.\n'No woman finds this shocking'\nThe outpouring on social media in relation to the Everard case speaks volumes.\nWhile some voiced their frustration over persistent victim-blaming, others highlighted how, once again, women were the ones being urged to change their behavior in order to stay safe, rather than the onus falling on men.\nGeorgia Ladbury, an infectious disease epidemiologist and candidate for the Women's Equality Party in upcoming London Assembly elections, tweeted Tuesday: \"Women in my area have been advised 'not to go out alone' while Sarah Everard's disappearance is investigated. How about we urge men not to go out instead? Say a curfew at nightfall?\n\"Perhaps we'd see more done about street safety if it were men losing their freedoms, not women.\"\nIn another tweet Thursday, she added: \"No woman finds this shocking. Because we're constantly planning and strategising how to prioritise our safety. Meanwhile, men are just living their lives and having carefree conversations. The very idea of that kind of freedom is intoxicating to me.\"\n\nSpeaking in the House of Lords during a debate Thursday on domestic violence, Green Party peer Baroness Jenny Jones proposed imposing a 6 p.m. curfew for men. \"I would argue that, at the next opportunity for any Bill that is appropriate, I might actually put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after 6 p.m., which I feel would make women a lot safer, and discrimination of all kinds would be lessened.\"\nCritic and columnist Sarah Ditum tweeted about \"men's horror at the idea of a man curfew,\" adding: \"No one should have their freedoms curtailed because of the violence of a minority, except women curtail our freedoms all the time because of the violence of a minority of men -- but freedoms aren't for women, are they?\"\nWriter Caitlin Moran made a similar point. \"Being a woman: my 'outside' day finishes at sundown. If I haven't taken the dog for a walk/jogged by then, I can't,\" she tweeted. \"In the winter, it often means the choice between exercise and work. Today, I had to stop work at 4 to exercise. My husband worked until 6, and is now off for a run.\"\nCall for action\nMen have also been joining in the conversation on Twitter, many in positive ways.\nOne tweet, from Stuart Edwards, has been widely shared. \"I live less than five minutes from where Sarah Everard went missing. Everyone is on high alert. Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor?\" he asked.\nWomen responded with appreciation that the question had been asked and offered practical suggestions such as a man dropping back or crossing the road so as to reassure a woman that she was not being followed, or offering to walk a female friend home.\nMeanwhile, lawmaker Jess Phillips, of the opposition Labour Party, called for tougher action to be taken against those who commit crimes against women, noting that rape convictions and domestic abuse prosecutions had fallen last year.\n\"We are not tough on crimes against women and children perpetrated by men,\" she tweeted. \"Women should be able walk the streets free from harm, fear and threat.\"\nDick, London's highest-ranking police officer, said there would be \"continued high levels of police patrols\" in the south London area where Everard was last seen, and acknowledged the impact of the suspected involvement of a police officer on public confidence.\n\"Sarah's disappearance in these awful and wicked circumstances is every family's worst nightmare,\" she said.\n\"The news today that it was a Metropolitan Police officer arrested on suspicion of Sarah's murder has sent waves of shock and anger through the public and through the whole of the Met.\"\n\n"}, {"title": "Prince William says royals are 'very much not a racist family' in first remarks since explosive interview", "author": "Angela Dewan and Schams Elwazer", "date": "2021-03-11", "full_article": "London (CNN)Prince William has denied the royal family is racist in his first public remarks since his brother Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan, made explosive claims in a TV interview.\nAsked by a reporter during a visit to a school in east London if the royals were a \"racist family,\" the Duke of Cambridge said, \"We're very much not a racist family.\"\nHarry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, made a series of damning accusations against the royal family in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, which aired in the UK on Monday night.\nIn response to a question on whether he had spoken to his brother since the interview with Oprah Winfrey, Prince William said, \"I haven't spoken to him yet but I will do.\"\nHarry and Meghan's interview has sent Buckingham Palace into a tailspin and triggered a nationwide debate on the royals, race and the role of the media in perpetuating xenophobia.\nIn the interview, Meghan said that the skin tone of the couple's child, Archie, was discussed as a potential issue before he was born. The couple would not reveal who had made the remarks, but said it wasn't Queen Elizabeth II or her husband, Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.\nThe palace broke its silence on Tuesday evening, saying in a statement on behalf of the Queen that the allegations of racism were concerning and were being \"taken very seriously.\"\n\"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,\" the statement read.\n\"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\"\nCNN correspondent Max Foster said Prince William's remarks were unusual and a sign of how rigid systems surrounding the monarchy were breaking down following the interview.\nFoster noted that the Duke of Cambridge \"decided to speak back\" to the reporter, despite the Queen's stated preference to handle the matter privately.\n\"This was a reporter at a major network, breaking a protocol which is not to throw questions out at senior royals in this way. So ... that's something that's broken down,\" he said Thursday.\n\"We've got to this point in the story where a senior royal is asked if his family is racist, which is just quite extraordinary.\"\nCouple cite lack of support\nIn the interview, Meghan described having regular suicidal thoughts during her pregnancy and brief time as a working royal, and the couple said the palace had offered Meghan and Archie inadequate security and protection.\nThe couple cited a lack of support over invasive press coverage and the royal institution's decision not to give their son Archie a title -- and with it his eligibility for protection -- as the basis for their decision to relocate from the UK.\nThe interview has also had consequences for the British press, whose tabloids are infamous for invading the privacy of royals and celebrities, and are regularly embroiled in legal battles for defamation.\nHigh-profile TV personality Piers Morgan stepped down from his role as presenter of ITV's \"Good Morning Britain,\" a day after questioning whether the Duchess was being truthful about having suicidal thoughts. Morgan stormed of the set live on TV as his own co-host, Alex Beresford, admonished him in a scathing rebuke of his remarks.\nThe Duchess of Sussex had complained about Morgan's remarks to the television station.\nThe executive director of the UK's Society of Editors, Ian Murray, resigned Wednesday after appearing in an interview in which he refused to acknowledge racist media coverage in the country.\nPrince Charles -- who is William and Harry's father, and heir to the throne -- appeared in public earlier on Tuesday for the first time and did not respond to a question on the furor surrounding his family.\nHarry had told Winfrey that his father had briefly stopped taking his calls after the couple announced they were stepping back from the royal family last January. He added that they were now speaking again.\nCNN will soon launch Royal News, a weekly newsletter bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls.

So not only as a business but also as a sport we definitely need spectators to return sooner than later ... we cannot survive without having spectators.\"\n\n\n'Required and appropriate'\nThe men's governing body will spend up to $5.2 million -- primarily taken from the bonus pool for the top 12 eligible players at the end of the season -- to boost prize money at its events until Wimbledon.\nThe WTA had to fund the entire prize money of $565,530 for its season opener in Abu Dhabi from its own funds.\n\"The reduction in prize money levels that are in place for 2021 is not something anyone wants to see,\" WTA CEO Steve Simon told Reuters.\n\"However, with the compromised revenue streams from ticketing and sponsorship being dealt with, the reductions are required and appropriate.\"\nBefore her early exit from this week's WTA 1000 event in Dubai, world No. 5 Elina Svitolina said reduced purses could potentially have an impact on motivation.\nAmericans John Isner and Reilly Opelka were less diplomatic when they hit out at ATP management recently for not taking salary cuts while players effectively were.\nGaudenzi said that even in the worst case scenario, the ATP was still tracking to deliver 2021 prize money levels of about $180 million, 23 percent less than 2019.\n\"It's still not a terrible result, considering the challenges we face,\" the Italian said, adding that most tournaments would be happy to break even in 2021.\nWith vaccines against the virus starting to roll out, tennis bosses were hopeful that restrictions on spectators would start to be relaxed.\n\"A no-crowd formula that extended into the future would require a restructuring of how sports in general would proceed,\" said WTA's Simon.\n\"We are beginning to see a pathway for fans to begin returning at restricted levels as 2021 progresses and hopefully a significant move towards full stadiums in 2022.\"\n\n"}]
